# MediaFunnel

MediaFunnel acts as a media aggregator, collecting [magnet links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) from the public and exposing them as a [syndicated feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication) for applications to consume.

### Installation and usage

If you simply want to use the application it can be accessed at [http://mediafunnel.tv](http://mediafunnel.tv).

If you want to have a look at the source and see how things work you can clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:requnix/mediafunnel.git` or [browse the code online](https://github.com/requnix/mediafunnel).

If you want to run the application it is a standard Rails 4 application using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com).

### Troubleshooting

If you have problems [log an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/requnix/mediafunnel/issues) and try to describe the problem in as much detail as possible. It would be appreciated if you first check that there isn't currently a matching oustanding issue.
